These are various logging extension libraries user can include to redirect logging
for some libraries to LogC.

It would be most ideal to just have LogC support optionally included in all
libraries but for that we are just too small project of course. Thankfully some
libraries allow hookup of custom logging solution. This repository contains
implementations for some of them. If you are maintainer of some library then
please consider adding support for LogC instead of implementing additional library
to this project.
